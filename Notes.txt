IPv4 Header
    What will be covered:
    IPv4 packet structure
    Fields of the IPv4 Header
    Last thing to update before final merge
    
Routing- the process routers use to determine the path that ip packets should take over a network to reach their destination.
Types of routing:
    Dynamic- using protocols such as OSPF to share routing info with each other automatically and build their routing table
    Static- a network engineer manually configures routes on the router

VTP- vlan trunking protocol
DTP- dynamic trunking protocol

Life of a packet
 Every device has its own mac address
 ffff.ffff.ffff is broadcast mac address
 pc1 > pc4 
    pc1 mac 1111 ip 192.168.1.1/24
    pc4 mac 4444 ip 192.168.4.1/24
    router 1 mac aaaa 
             mac bbbb
    router 2 mac cccc
             mac dddd
    router 4 mac eeee
             mac fffe (all F is broadcast)
router 1 is default gateway
ARP request to get to default gateway (bridge between user and internet or other networks)
    src ip 192.168.1.1
    dst ip 192.168.1.254
    dst mac ffff.ffff.ffff
    src mac 1111
Send frame and continue sending once MAC address is found, repeating until it reaches pc4

Vlans
    LAN- a group of devices in a single location/ broadcast domain, all devices will receive a broadcast frame (FFFF.FFFF.FFFF)
    Vlans logically separate end hosts at layer 2
    Switches do not forward traffic between vlans, they must be sent through a router
    vlans 1, 1002-1005 exit by default and cannot be deleted
    An access port is a switch port which belongs to a single vlan, and usually connects to end hosts like PCs.
    Switchports which carry multiple vlans are called trunk ports.
