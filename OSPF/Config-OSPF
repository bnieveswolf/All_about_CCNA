once all ip are set up on router:
On router 4
en
conf t
int l0 (this is creating a loopback int)
ip add 4.4.4.4 255.255.255.255 (this is a loopback of 4.4.4.4/32)
do show int l0 (shows netmask of int)
router ospf 1
network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 area 0 (configures all interfaces with ospf to area 0, a wildcard subnet mask is used so this equals 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0)
pass g0/0 (passive interface)
pass l0 (interfaces connected to end hosts where they dont need to recieve hello messages)

On router 3
same steps as previous until opsf configuration on interfaces with different loopback
network 10.0.13.2 0.0.0.0 area 0 (settign each interface individually)
network 10.0.34.1 0.0.0.0 area 0 

On router 2
same steps as previous until opsf configuration on interfaces with different loopback
net 10.0.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0
net 2.2.2.2 0.0.0.0 area 0

On router 1
same steps as previous until opsf configuration on interfaces with different loopback
network 10.0.12.0 0.0.0.3 area 0   
network 10.0.13.0 0.0.0.3 area 0
passive int l0
default-information originate (make routers send to here to reach internet)
exit
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2 (settign next hop to internet)
show ip protocols
